Business Practices  
**Software/Systems Architecture**  
It’s important to think about the product/s, cost, performance, security, regulation, speed to market, current expertise, the longevity of the technology, ability to hire engineers/designers, expected quality, and the overall expectations of the leaders among other things.  This is my greatest strength.  I know enterprise software architects can’t make a good decision about the direction of the software without having a fundamental understanding of the business.  I spend lots of my time asking questions, thinking about the range of options available, and putting a plan together for each and all of the businesses and products.  No case is the same, it’s important to be able to think about all the angles and how change may affect each situation.  Not every plan will work for every product, you need to be able to understand which processes/technology work and which don’t; adjusting plans accordingly.  I put significant effort into laying out the options, the risks, the chances of success and failure, and what the business and I need to have the best chances for success.

**People/Culture/Process**  
All three are interwoven.  The process only works if the people support it and both culture and process allow the people to be successful both for the business and for themselves.  Change in each can happen, but it’s very important to get buy-in from the people that make it happen, and that can only work if they trust the business and direction.  There are many different cultures and processes, and depending on the situation I have very different plans to handle each.  However, I approach each situation the same, I listen and understand.  Often small changes to the process allow the best people to lead both the culture and people changes as needed, having business and leadership support goes a long way in a short amount of time.  I put a lot of effort into earning the trust of the people I work with, this is no different, if the trust and respect are there, change can and will happen.

**UI/UX Design**  
I’ve spent most of my career working on or in this field.  I often find it’s the most important part of the software being developed and business expectations for both have risen quickly with how successfully Google, Apple, Amazon, and many startups have been able to steal markets with UX as a priority.  The success of a design relies on consistency and cleanliness.  Neilson Group and Google have both put lots of time and effort into open-sourcing their findings and research to support their directions.  Each project designer I have worked with/for me is aware of these options as well as I expect all the developers working in the UI space to be aware of what works, what doesn’t and why.  Often I ask employees to read “The Design of Everyday Things” to find and help fix design flaws as they develop the product.  I’ve found that no design is ever perfect, like Toyota, it’s important to have the people creating the product know how to spot and fix the issues as they arise.  This is a difficult cultural shift for many developers, but being a part of planning and having some basic knowledge and understanding of what they are building often solves that problem immediately.

**Business/Change**  
I work very closely with the business.  I generally need to understand expectations early to be able to make changes to the technology or processes.  This can come in the form of a changing market, new idea, or change in the budget.  I like to bring ideas from the technology side as well.  Often the business sees value in products for purchase.  I have spent lots of time evaluating and purchasing helpful products that both help the end consumer or the business conduct sales and marketing.  I am very good at digging into 3rd party technologies, understanding limitations, and making recommendations.  I listen to understand the business's differentiation, in-house expertise, risk, as well as support for each product the business proposes purchasing.  I look at all the same things related to the systems/software architecture above to diagnose success or failure and I know how to dig into the details of each product.

**Management**  
I manage both contractors and FTEs, many of who are older than I am and have worked in the business longer than I have.  Trust and respect are always the most important parts of those relationships.  I regularly send an anonymous survey to get a sense of the current feelings my employees have for me.  I appreciate feedback and listen to the people that work for me.  I always take the feedback and put effort into understanding how I could do a better job.  This may not necessarily mean I agree with the feedback, but I work to understand why an employee may have that view or expectation.  I change accordingly.

**Hiring**  
I have hired over 100 people in my career, mostly engineers, but also scrum masters and product owners as well as numerous specialty roles.  Engineers, I  look at three important aspects of their role, their ability to develop software, their ability to work on a team, and their ability to change or direct the architecture of the software.  Every hire generally has a strength in one of each of the listed areas.  The most productive teams have a good mix of all three.  I don’t hire for a specific skill unless it’s something I don’t think would benefit an employee, but I expect the skill-specific employees to also be able to adjust as needed to change.  Occasionally the fit is poor, I’m generally quick to see this and make changes as needed.  Many people throughout my career have thought this is an area I excel.

Personal Adversity  
**Father passed away in 2004 at age 19**  
I learned early in my life what it’s like to lose someone you love dearly.  I learned how valuable life is and the importance of the people in my life and how easily they can be taken away.  I find this relatable to business because everyone will likely go through many forms of adversity, I can relate, I am often the first person co-workers seek out for guidance in their times of trouble.  I have a tendency to really feel the pain they are going through and can help guide them better than most.

**Fell off a roof at age 20**  
I shattered my left kneecap and right ankle.  I was bedridden and in a wheelchair for 3 months.  I managed to recover well and quickly enough to hike 4 famous tramps in New Zealand 6 months after falling.  I learned the amount of effort it takes to recover mentally and physically from a devastating injury and the adversity it creates in your life.  There was a good chance I wouldn’t be able to walk again.  The doctors, physical therapists, and friends helped me recover quickly.  Often the chips aren’t stacked in your favor, having the strength to work through them over time is important and may take a lot of time, I learned how to be very patient when I needed to be.  Sticking to a long-term goal can be tough, but sometimes that is the only way to accomplish what you set out to achieve.

Other Experience  
**Mountain Climbing**  
I have climbed many 14ers in Colorado and in 2019 climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.  There are two important aspects to this, one is preparation and the second is mental strength.  Being able to know when you’re not prepared is just as important as being mentally strong.  Often you need to turn around and go down because either the plan failed, you physically can’t continue or you mentally aren’t strong enough yet, but taking too much risk could result in your life and no more chances.  It’s important to know failure is temporary as long as you have another day to try again.

**Travel**  
I have traveled to 30+ countries (6 continents) and some for over 90 days at a time.  I have opened myself to new cultures and experiences learning so much about the people's countries I’ve visited.  I learned throughout this that it’s important to keep an open mind, listen, and understand the plight of others.  I use this daily to nurture the relationships I have with my employees, managers, and co-workers.  Trust and respect are so important.  I work very hard to understand others, their feelings, and what their needs are.

**Competition**  
I ran track in college and competed in seven ski marathons and many bike races over the years.  Each one is adverse in its own way.  This gives me time to challenge myself, put in individual preparation, and understand myself and what I can do each time I compete.  It’s a great way to recalibrate my mental and physical toughness.  In 2021 I completed a race across Minnesota (241 miles) that took another level of physical and mental strength that was new to me biking for 19 straight hours, I learned a lot about my fitness and mental strength when my body started to break down.

**Reading/Learning**  
I enjoy reading, I read about 20 non-fiction books a year and numerous fiction books as well.  Generally, I specifically enjoy psychology books.  I find they help me understand how I think as well as others around me.  I keep up on the latest technology through books, but more often blogs.  I’m a fast learner and learn by doing, I do this for some of the consulting projects I do outside of my day-to-day job.  I often bring these learnings back to the business.

**Personality**  
I am a patient and humble person, I’m satisfied both with what I’ve done and where I am in life.  But I know I can change things and I have a lot to offer.  I put most of my effort towards being respected and trustworthy as well as ethical.  I care deeply for the people who work for me, work with me, and who I work for.  I am a hard worker, but know my limits and put time into relaxing and being with my family.  I try my best to be the happiest person I can be every day.

**Creativity**  
Being able to deal with change comes from being creative.  I spend time playing the guitar, drawing, and building things.  Brightpeak/Thrivent had a large focus on flexing our creative muscles, thinking outside the box, and being ok with outside perspectives.  I find this all very important to how I conduct my work.  The ability to adapt and change is a creative endeavor.
